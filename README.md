## Current features:

### Graveyards and Gravestones:
* A new structure called the Eternal Graveyard, full of ghosts, gravestones and a danger-filled crypt in the middle, rewarding you good loot, and the all elusive Grimsteel.

* the Gravestone of Stashing does not save you from death like a totem, however, it does save your items from certain demise, by storing it into itself, and placing itself down. It will work as long as you have it directly in your inventory--no off hand needed!

* Grimsteel Sickles are a new weapon that can be dual-wielded. On top of this, they have a custom enchantment called 'Tipping'. Tipping will make it so whatever effect you have will transfer to the sickles' blades whenever you hit an entity with them.
  
* 3 new Mobs, all locals to the Eternal Graveyard, all decently fleshed out in their features
* One new Boss mob, the Prime Spirit. I wont spoil much here ;)

* Many many new blocks with Grimsteel used in their recipes
* One new painting variant

### Deeper and Darker:
* Many new blocks stemming from the Sculk Spine, a block found naturally generating & in loot chests in Ancient Cities.
  
* Sculk Spines can drop __Sculk Sacs__, a one time use item that stores experience. These can also be crafted into Sculk Sac blocks from their 'full' counterparts.



## FAQ
Q: Is this compatible with other mods that add gravestones?

A: Absolutely not. It'll just crash at the sight of eachother. However I do suggest trying this mod's implementation of Gravestones before sticking with the one you normally use! You may like mine more, or not.



Q: Will you backport to ___ / Will you port this mod to (Other Modloader)?

A: Nah. I ask you to not port this mod to any other modlaoders, however if you wish to backport to older versions for personal use, go on ahead. I mean, I'm not sure why or how you would--but go off I guess!
